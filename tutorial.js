// var , let , const 
//var is globally scoped 
//let you can reassign values 
//const means it cannot be changed 
//always use const unless you know you are gonna reassign it to make your code more robust 
//Data types => Strings, numbers, boolean, null, undefined

const name = 'John';
const num = 19;
const isCool = true; 
const rating = 4.5; //there is not float data type in js, it is just a number
const x = null; 
const y = undefined; 
console.log(typeof y);
